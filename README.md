# A-cloud-based-remote-compilation-platform
A cloud-based remote compilation platform that breathes new life into your idle servers or Raspberry Pi.matplotlib image transmission.
### This project addresses the following scenarios:
1. Need to edit and compile code on Windows, macOS, Android, or iOS devices but lack the necessary environment?
2. Have an idle server and don’t know how to utilize it?
3. Some cloud compilation platforms on the market don’t support multi-file programming, while those that do require payment?
4. Want to build a comprehensive cloud compiler of your own instead of storing code on third-party cloud compilation platforms?

I understand this project is not unprecedented—there are many excellent similar products like Code-Server and Eclipse Che. However, I still intend to "reinvent the wheel" to offer a more customized option through this product.

here is some shows about diffrent languages:
